//! # MagicEntry
//!
//! A smol identity provider.
//!
//! This documentation is targeted to contributors and auditors.
//! MagicEntry is not a library and that's why the code and docs do not live
//! in crates.io and docs.io. My thought was to have this page open alongside
//! the code to be able to traverse and understand code & protocols faster.
//!
//! The code is split as I saw fit, in the following structure:
//! - `src/*.rs`: Code that implements the "core" functionality of
//! the app - config, login, logout, static files, etc.
//! - `secret/`: This came more of a necessity as it's very much a core functionality
//! but I wanted to have a directory to glance over the very-security-related
//! code
//! - `auth_url`: Oof this was a curve ball. It's essentially an authentication/authorization
//! protocol, much like SAML or OIDC but nginx and other reverse proxies implement
//! it at will, without a spec. Check out the module for more info
//! - `oidc`: OpenID connect implementation
//! - `saml`: SAML implementation - a hacky one but it works
//! - `webauthn`: Passkey login implementation - allows a user to register
//! and authenticate with a passkey
//!
//! ## Tests
//!
//! While the project is not test-driven, some aspects of the application has
//! proven to be fragile in some aspects (most notably post-login redirects,
//! webauthn login and group matching) and a need for proper end-to-end tests
//! has arose.
//!
//! While I tried to use rust's excellent test harness, the resulting code
//! is too cumbersome and breaks too often, due to internal changes,
//! that's why the "main" e2e tests are in [hurl](https://hurl.dev). It's
//! a way to define HTTP requests and assert the responses in an easy to understand,
//! almost plain-text manner.
//!
//! The easiest way to run them is as follows:
//!
//! ```bash
//! pnpm test
//! ```
//!
//! The script sets up a magicentry server with the `config.sample.yaml` as
//! a config file, a tiny webserver serving the `./hurl` directory (we'll get there)
//! and finally fires up hurl to execute the actual test requests.
//!
//! It should automatically watch for file changes and re-do all the tests,
//! a nice way to fix some bugs
//!
//! The "tiny webserver" is required as there's no easy way to feed external
//! dynamic data to hurl during runtime, so to give the login link to hurl
//! (normally delivered to users via email or a webhook), magicentry writes the
//! link to a file within the hurl dir (`./hurl/.link.txt`). This behavior of
//! course should not be allowed in production builds so it's feature-gated
//! behind `e2e-test`
